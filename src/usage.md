# Usage

To get started first run in the flake directory: `grep -rl asynth | xargs sed -i 's/asynth/<username>/g'` with `<username>` being the username you want for your computer.

Configure options in `hosts/<filename>/configuration.nix` and import the `hardware-configuration.nix` generated by NixOS.

In the flake, add your hostname as configured in `configuration.nix` with the `hostName` option under nixosConfigurations with the syntax of `clib.mkSystem "<architecture-opeating_system>" hosts/<filename>/configuration.nix {inherit inputs nixvim clib <other args>;}`

The location of the configuration can be changed with the `flakePath` option. 

Rebuild your system, and run `sudo passwd <username>` to setup the password for your username.
